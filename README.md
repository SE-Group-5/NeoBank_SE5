Team Collaboration Rules

Design your frontend components by creating a respective folder for them under the src folder.

Create your folders for respective features in the backend too. Common API routes such as middleware should be added in the middleware folder under the backend.

Write a few tests for your feature as you develop it. refer app.test.js and setupTests.js files and official documentation for more help.

Do not edit the code of other features without its respective developer's consent.

keep updating the status of the feature as it progresses on JIRA.

Routing for all components will be added as we progress, hence as of now do not modify app.js or index.js while pushing code.

Always pull the latest code before developing, resolve conflicts regularly. Provide understandable names and commit messages.

Create your branch for your feature and add code as per the above rules to avoid merge conflicts while merging branches at the end.
